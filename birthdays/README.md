This is a simple Django app that will store employee names, emails, birthdates, and favorite ice cream flavors to have in the office on their birthday. 

Get calls can be made to the /birthdays endpoint with the following parameters:
- Name: Search by name
- Ice Cream Flavor: Find people who have a particular favorite
- Month: Search for the people who have birthdays in a particular month. Months must be in the format MMM (e.g., Nov or Mar)

There are several basic tests in testme.py.
